## Project Overview
This project provides a password strength checker that evaluates passwords based on multiple complexity criteria. It not only calculates a strength score but also gives clear, practical suggestions for improving weak or fair passwords.

## Features
- Evaluates password strength and assigns a score out of 100.
- Classifies passwords into four categories: WEAK, FAIR, GOOD, and STRONG.
- Checks for common password complexity rules:
  - Minimum length
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Provides actionable recommendations to improve weak passwords.
- Suggests using passphrases or avoiding predictable patterns.

## Strength Classification
- WEAK: < 30
- FAIR: 30 – 59
- GOOD: 60 – 79
- STRONG: 80 – 100
